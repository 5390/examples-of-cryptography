# examples-of-cryptography
This repository provides practical examples of cryptographic algorithms using Golang. It includes AES, RSA, ECC, SHA-256, bcrypt, key exchange mechanisms like ECDH, digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519), and post-quantum cryptography with CIRCL. Real-world use cases include secure file encryption, JWT signing, and password hashing.
